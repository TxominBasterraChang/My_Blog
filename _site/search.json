    "text": "Abstract\nThis thesis uses a novel data set to investigate the relationship between entry and exit of newspapers and electoral participation in Swiss federal elections 1848-1955. Exploiting the variation in net entries of newspapers within election years between cantons I find that the net entry of one or more newspapers has a significant positive impact on electoral participation. The impact is larger for political newspapers. German language newspapers exert a positive and significant effect whereas for French language newspapers no significance can be established. Even stronger positive effects are detected when specifying German political and weekly newspapers. I also show that liberal newspapers were especially important for inducing electoral participation. The effect is positive and significant before 1917 but vanishes after the introduction of the proportional voting system in 1919. The results are limited to the inclusion of the top-newspaper-cantons Bern, Vaud and Zürich indicating that the impact of newspapers on voter turnout is largely driven by these cantons.\n\n\nIntroduction\nA well-functioning independent press has been seen as a vital element of modern democracies (Drago, Nannicini, and Sobbrio 2013). In the field of political science there is a long tradition in viewing the media as an essential part of informing the general public about political affairs. Among all media types, specially newspapers were historically attributed an impact on public opinion and electoral outcomes. Various aspects of newspapers’ influence have been covered in previous literature: Schaffner (2006) studies the impact of newspapers on incumbent advantage. Ferraz and Finan (2008) and Snyder and Strömberg (2010) investigate the relationship between newspaper and political accountability. And Gerber, Karlan and Bergan (2009) examine the effect of newspapers’ support for certain parties and political opinion.\nBesides an extensive literature on the relationship of media on political participation (Gentzkow 2006; Oberholzer-Gee and Waldfogel 2009; Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson 2011; Perlman and Sprick Schuster 2016), a growing number of empirical literature is specifically concerned about newspapers and electoral participation.\nChapp and Aehl (2021) investigate the effect of declining circulation rates of newspapers in US local elections. They find evidence that newspaper have an influence on how thoroughly voters fill out their ballot. Lee and Wei (2008) find that the decrease of US newspaper readership among young adults is associated with a decrease in political participation. Arendt and Brantner (2015) look at the effect of “quality” press on the 2014 EU parliamentary elections and conclude that the exposure to this type of media increases turnout through the mediation of knowledge and efficacy.\nWithin this field of literature, the special case of newspaper entry and exit has recently been investigated in US, Italian and Swiss markets.\n\nGentzkow, Shapiro and Sinkinson (2011) look at the entry and exit of US daily newspapers between the years 1869-1924 when newspapers held a dominant position in terms of political information. They explore the impact of the entry and exit on political participation as well as party vote share and electoral competitiveness. Their findings suggest that newspapers have a significant positive effect on participation which however decreases as the second, third or following newspaper are observed. Drago, Nannicina and Sobbrio (2014) evaluate the effect of newspaper entry and exit in Italian cities between 1993-2010. Using a similar methodology to Gentzkow et al. (2011) , they find evidence that the net entry of newspapers increases turnout in municipal elections, the reelection probability of incumbent mayors, as well as the efficiency of municipal government.\nMuth and Nguyen (2021) investigate the impact of newspaper entry and exit on electoral participation and party vote share in Swiss federal elections between the years 1896-1917. Using a data set of 1,466 Swiss newspapers and 49 constituencies, they find evidence for a positive relationship between newspapers and turnout. They also find that the political influence of newspapers varies depending on the newspaper’s languages.\n\nIn this thesis, I pose related questions for a longer time period: What impact does the entry and exit of newspapers have on voter turnout in Switzerland between 1848 and 1955? And does this impact vary over different newspaper groups and time? Despite the recent study on the subject, there is no long term study which utilizes the newspaper lexicon “Bibliography der Schweizer Presse” by Fritz Blaser which comprises the years 1650-1958. This enables me to conduct an analysis of a much larger time span. Applying a similar methodology and reasoning as is in the above mentioned studies I formulate my main hypothesis:\nMain hypothesis More informed citizens tend to vote more often. If newspapers inform the general public, then a higher number of newspapers should induce a higher voter turnout.\nOther factors may also play a role when investigating the relationship between newspapers and turnout. Generally, some specific newspapers might be more likely to inform the general public about affairs relevant for their increased voting behavior. So, a higher presence of these newspapers could then induce a higher voter turnout. In the following I will consider important aspects of these newspaper subgroups\n\nPolitical vs. non-political: Political newspapers might be more able to induce citizens to vote (Kübler and Goodman 2018). On the flip side, non-political newspapers might not play this informational role and could therefore miss to engage citizens. For the Swiss case, Muth and Nguyen (2021) find significant evidence for a positive relationship between political newspapers and turnout. In contrast, non-political newspapers even show a negative, though insignificant coefficient.\nLanguage: Switzerland is a multilingual nation with German and French being the most common languages. Muth and Nguyen (2021) show that variation in newspaper’s effect is present if languages are distinguished. They specifically look at German and French political newspapers where a significant positive relationship is detected for the German but not for the French ones. This might be explained through content-presentational front page variations between these newspapers (Muth and Nguyen, 2021, p. 11).\nHistorical trends: The data set covers a long period (1848-1955) which spans through different technological eras, changes in the electoral system, and two world wars. Therefore, potential newspaper effects could have been driven or absorbed by events marking these periods. Concerning the influence of radio and television, most of the period under investigation spans through an era where print media was the only source of political information. Radio did not get popular in Switzerland until the 1930s and the first television broadcast was only introduced in 1953 (DRS, 2008). However, variation could be present between newspapers active in the pre-radio and the radio era.\nIdeological affiliation: Muth and Nguyen (2021) investigate the relationship between party affiliated newspapers and party vote share. Related to this, differences might also be observed in newspaper’s ability to induce higher electoral participation when distinguishing between ideological affiliations. Until 1917 Switzerland was politically dominated by the liberal-radicals which strongly influenced the design of the constitution of 1848 and hence the Swiss federal system in which cantonal elections are an essential aspect (Schweizer Parlament, n.d.). Newspapers associated with a liberal-radical ideology and thus proponents of liberal-radical politics could have therefore been more supportive of electoral participation compared to other newspapers.\nMedia market environment: the effect might differ with the number of newspapers (i.e., competitors) already present in the media market. Drago et al. (2014) investigate competition by measuring how the effect of entry and exit varies between the first and subsequent newspapers. If some form of competition is present then the effect should not be limited to the first newspaper in the market. Another case is that an additional newspaper in a market with few papers might impact turnout more than an additional newspaper in a market with many (relative change matters).\n\nThe advantage of working with a large data set, both in time and depth, comes along with the challenging task of accounting and controlling for historical events which might influence both the outcome and the independent variable. Coverage of all mentioned aspects would exceed the scope of my thesis. Here, I will focus on three additional research propositions which account for the distinction between political and non-political newspapers, the language diversity of Switzerland and the potential influence of newspaper’s ideology before and after Switzerland changed its electoral law in 1919. All these hypothesis are built on the main hypothesis stated above:\n\nPolitical newspapers matter: Since political newspapers are more likely to inform the general public about affairs relevant for their increase voting behavior, they should induce a significantly higher voter turnout than non-political newspapers.\nLanguage matters: German and French are the predominant languages both in terms of newspapers and language regions. The effects might vary when looking at German vs French newspaper.\nLiberal newspapers matter: Since the political landscape before 1917 was dominated by liberal parties, the estimated coefficient on electoral participation is expected to differ significantly compared to the period after 1919.\n\nAn extensive investigation of all ideological types would be interesting but cannot be attempted here. Because liberal newspaper and parties are major players in Swiss political history the focus is set on these. My arguments rely on the widely held working hypothesis that information constitutes the main mechanism for linking newspapers to political participation (Mastuka, 1995). On the individual level, higher education and income have often been identified as the driving forces (Rosenstone, 1980). There is debate on how information incentivizes citizens to vote. One explanation is, that by supplying information to voters, newspapers could simply remind people that an election is pending. Newspapers could also have an indirect effect on turnout by increasing social capital of readers (Genzkow et al. 2011).\nThe baseline assumption is that on the aggregated canton (federated state) level, readership increases with the number of newspapers. Even though readership numbers are not recorded in the main newspaper data set, evidence from an additional data source (Bürging, 1939) nevertheless shows that newspaper circulation for a subset of years and newspapers strongly increased over time. Following Gentzkow et al. (2011) and Drago et al. (2014), readership is estimated by multiplying newspaper circulation by two, assuming that every copy is read by two individuals (details are provided in the appendix).\nIn order to test my hypotheses, I employ the identification strategy which compares electoral outcomes in cantons that experienced a change in the number of newspapers due to entry or exit (treatment group) to cantons with no change (control group). This strategy is built on the assumption that “exits and entries cause large, discrete changes in newspaper readership” (Gentzkow et al. 2011, p. 2,981). Swiss elections are held at the end of October and thus a newspaper entering in the election year could likely have enough time to supply the market prior to the election (Swiss Parlament, n.d.). For the identification to hold, pre-event trends have to be ruled out since any occurrence of these would indicate correlation between newspapers in the election period and past electoral participation which would then imply the existence of confounding factors.\nThe identification assumption is that cantons with no change represent a valid control group if canton and election fixed effects as well as a set of socio-economic variables are controlled for. In the model, these controls will include population, sector employment and language. In order to test the main hypothesis, the whole set of newspapers is regressed on turnout in different specifications. To test for different subgroups such as political vs non-political or German vs French, as well as for different time periods such as pre-1917 and post-1917, regression is simply repeated on these subgroups and periods. And to test for the influence of market environment, canton-years are first grouped into different quantiles according to the newspapers numbers present in their market.\nI find that the net entry of newspapers has a significant positive impact on electoral participation. The impact is larger for political newspapers. German language newspapers exert a positive and significant effect whereas for French language newspapers no significance can be detected. Even stronger positive effects are found when specifying German political and weekly newspapers.\nI also show that liberal newspapers were especially important for inducing electoral participation. The effect is positive and significant before 1917 but vanishes after the introduction of the proportional voting system in 1919. However, the results are limited to the inclusion of the top-newspaper-cantons Bern, Vaud and Zürich indicating that the impact of newspapers on voter turnout is largely driven by these cantons.\nThis thesis mostly contributes to the empirical literature investigating historical political participation in Switzerland. It reevaluates past findings of Muth and Nguyen (2021) and extends the scope of understanding by providing further evidence from previously unexploited data.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nArendt, Florian, and Cornelia Brantner. 2015. “Quality Press and Voter Turnout: Evidence for Causal Effects and Its Underlying Mechanisms.” Studies in Communication Sciences 15 (2): 164–72. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scoms.2016.01.002.\n\n\nChapp, Christopher, and Peter Aehl. 2021. “Newspapers and Political Participation: The Relationship Between Ballot Rolloff and Local Newspaper Circulation.” Newspaper Research Journal 42 (2): 235–52. https://doi.org/10.1177/07395329211014968.\n\n\nDrago, Francesco, Tommaso Nannicini, and Francesco Sobbrio. 2013. “Meet the Press: How Voters and Politicians Respond to Newspaper Entry and Exit.” SSRN Electronic Journal. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2205638.\n\n\n———. 2014. “Meet the Press: How Voters and Politicians Respond to Newspaper Entry and Exit.” American Economic Journal: Applied Economics 6 (3): 159–88. https://doi.org/10.1257/app.6.3.159.\n\n\nFerraz, Claudio, and Frederico Finan. 2008. “Exposing Corrupt Politicians: The Effects of Brazil’s Publicly Released Audits on Electoral Outcomes*.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 123 (2): 703–45. https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.2008.123.2.703.\n\n\nGentzkow, Matthew. 2006. “Television and Voter Turnout*.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 121 (3): 931–72. https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.121.3.931.\n\n\nGentzkow, Matthew, Jesse M Shapiro, and Michael Sinkinson. 2011. “The Effect of Newspaper Entry and Exit on Electoral Politics.” American Economic Review 101 (7): 2980–3018. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.101.7.2980.\n\n\nGerber, Alan S, Dean Karlan, and Daniel Bergan. 2009. “Does the Media Matter?

    "text": "The Swiss Federal System\nFederalism and direct democracy are major features of the Swiss political system. Every year multiple ballots or “Abstimmung” are held in each canton where citizens are required to vote on important communal decisions such as governmental spendings, investment in infrastructure, schooling or defense issues. In this work I will not focus on this aspect of the Swiss direct democracy but on the Swiss federal elections. Elections or “Wahlen” differ from ballots in the sense that they are periodically repeating events with a homogenous character compared to very heterogenous aspects in public-affairs-decision making (Poledna, 2021). Within the period of investigation the Swiss federal election for the Swiss parliament were held roughly every three to four years. The electoral system is based on the Swiss federal constitution of 1848 which grants every adult male citizens aged 20 + the right to vote. Cantons are given freedom regarding the exact implementation of the voting law. This includes the enforcement of sanctioned compulsory voting rules which were introduced by 13 cantons for particular election years during the period of investigation (Hangartner et al., 2011). The first election took place in 1848 and was then held every 3 years until 1931 with 1919 being an exception. In 1931 the term of office was extended to four years.\nThe year 1918 marked one of the most important turning points in Swiss electoral history. After being one of the main topics of public political discourse over the years and after two failed referenda, the electoral system switched from being held in a majoritarian fashion where the “winner takes it all” to a proportional system where parliamentary seats were allocated according to the percentage of votes (Petrov, 2018). As a result, smaller parties that were highly disadvantaged under the previous majoritarian system, gained governmental influence after the reform. Until then, Switzerland’s political system was mostly dominated by liberal-radical parties (Gruner et al., 1990). The event of 1918 was accompanied by social uprising and political conflict. In a phase of economic instability stemming from the repercussions of the First World War, the urge for political change was rising. After liberal-radicals again won the parliamentary elections in 1917 despite of the salient drop in vote share, discontent about political stagnation lead to a series of strikes and finally culminated in a general strike which started in Zürich and quickly spread into the whole of Switzerland. Under the pressure of the general strike the election planned for 1920 was advanced to 1919.\nAfterwards, liberal-radical groups lost their dominance which was then followed by the rise of social- democratic, conservative and the so called Bauern-, Gewerbe- und Bürger parties (Petrov, 2018). Figure 8 depicts the aggregated vote share of the liberal parties FL (Freisinnige Linke) and LM (Liberale Mitte), the gains and losses the liberals registered between elections (D_liberals), as well as the aggregated vote share of all other elected parties in the federal elections (1848-1955). In 1893 the FL changed its name to FDP (Freisinnig Demokratische Partei der Schweiz) and in 1914 the LM changed its name to LPS (Liberale Partei der Schweiz).\nAmong liberal parties, the FL/and later FDP always received the highest vote share. Up to 1928 the FL/FDP constantly achieved the highest vote share among all parties. After that, it was surpassed by the rise of the social democrats SP (Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz).\nStriking is the sharp drop of liberal vote share in the election of 1917 one years before the introduction of the proportional system and the following gradual diminution.\n\n\n\n\ni_am(\"index.qmd\")\nTURNOUT_31 <- read_excel(here(\"Files\", \"Excel\", \"Voteshare_liberals.xlsx\"))\nA <- TURNOUT_31\nA = A %>% mutate(liberals = FL + LM)\nA = A %>% mutate(others = 100 - liberals)\nA = A %>% mutate(delta_liberals = diff_Fl + diff_LM)\nA = A %>% select(-c(FL, LM, diff_Fl, diff_LM))\nA_long<- gather(A, party, outcomme, liberals:delta_liberals, factor_key=TRUE)\n\nggplot(data = A_long, aes(x = Year, y = outcomme, group = party, colour = party)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_ipsum() + \n  ggtitle(\"Figure 1: Turnout (1848-1955)\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y =  \"Turnout in %\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of Voter Turnout\nLooking at the entire voting history of federal elections, Switzerland experienced an W-shape development in electoral participation. In the first elections starting 1848 roughly 44.6% of eligible voters went to vote. During the period of political dominance by the liberal radicals before 1919, turnout averaged 54.8%. Between 1919 and 1935, after the introduction of the proportional voting system, electoral participation reached an average level of 80%. In the period after the extension of the term in office to 4 years, participation decreased to 60%. Starting 1979, which lies outside of my investigation, turnout dropped for the first time below 50% (Neidhart, 2017).\n\ni_am(\"index.qmd\")\nTURNOUT_31 <- read_excel(here(\"Files\", \"Excel\", \"TURNOUT.xlsx\"))\nA <- TURNOUT_31\n\nggplot(data = A, aes(x = Year, y = Turnout, group = Year)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +  \n  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, aes(group=language, colour = language), geom = \"line\", lwd=0.5, lty=1) +\ntheme_ipsum() + \n  ggtitle(\"Figure 2:Turnout (1848-1955)\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y =  \"Turnout in %\") \n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 depicts boxplots per election term for turnout within the period 1848-1955. Striking is the transition between 1917 and 1919 where electoral participation increased significantly throughout all language regions. Also, after 1919 there seems to be an increased number of outlier cantons which experienced significantly lower turnout results than the majority. Noticeable is also that voter turnout in French-speaking regions is almost always lower compared to the German ones. Italian speaking regions lie mostly in between.\n\n\nExpansion of Newspapers\nThe development of the press went along the rise of the bourgeoise in the 19th century. Previously, a phase of slow growth in newspapers preceded until the end of the 18th century. The years after the breakdown of the “13örtige Eidgenossenschaft” under the Helvetic republic with the proclamation of press freedom in 1798, the start of the “Regeneration”- period in 1831, and the establishment of the national congress in 1848 (embedding freedom of the press into the constitution) all experienced a large increase in newspaper founding (Blaser, 1954; Clavien et al. 2015).\nSwitzerland’s liberal press regulations facilitated the formation of many opinion presses which, due to the country’s small scale, were often addressing a local audience on regional politics. During the period of regeneration opinion presses were an important factor through which press freedom was promoted. The commercialization of the press started differently for different language regions: First in the French then in the German and not until the end of the 20th century in the Italian speaking regions.\nIn German language regions the professionalization at the end of the 19th century was followed by the foundation of the association of Swiss press (Verein der Schweizer Presse) and the foundation of the Swiss publishers association (Schweizerischer Verlegerverband). Technical improvements like the introduction of rotary printing in 1890 and the linotype machine in 1893 greatly improved productivity and reduced the costs of printing. The emergence of news agencies facilitated the collection of information for the associated newspapers; and the development of infrastructure for distribution and postal services enabled large scale circulation. Investment in new technologies mainly required funding through advertisement (Genzkow et al. 2014, Clavien et al 2014), which was followed by the emergence of profit oriented non-partisan newspapers. On the demand site, increasing literacy rates starting from 1850 can also account for the expansion of newspapers (Messerli and Mathieu, 1992, p. 177-178). In German speaking regions the appearance of literature clubs (Lesegesellschaften) provided an inexpensive access to newspapers which reasonably extended readership.\n\nload(\"/Users/txomin/Desktop/My_Blog/Files/Data_Frames/N_combined12.Rda\")\nA <- N_combined12\nnames(A)[names(A) == \"Kanton_ID\"] <- \"canton\"\n\n\nggplot(data = A %>% subset(Year >= 1848)  %>% subset(Year <= 1955), \n       aes(x = Year, y = numb_news, group = Year)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, aes(group=canton, colour = canton), \n               geom = \"line\", lwd=0.5, lty=1, \n                 data = . %>% filter(canton %in% c(\"Zürich\" , \"Bern\", \"Vaud\"))) +\n  theme_ipsum() + \n  ggtitle(\"Newspapers (1848-1955)\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y =  \"Newspapers\") \n\n\n\n\nThe graphics depict different aspects of Swiss newspaper growth. Figure 10 clearly shows that the net increase of newspapers is positive over the years (presented are yearly boxplots of newspaper numbers per canton). Notable is that the cantons Bern, Vaud and Zürich exhibit significantly larger newspaper numbers compared to the rest of Switzerland."

The Spanish Houses dataset from Kagglecontains sales information on Spanish real estate of March 2017. In this exercise, I want to give a brief demonstration of text analysis in R.\nThe data is coming from the Kaggle data set on Spanish houses. I am using the here-package to preserve the folder structure and easily find the files of interest.\n\ni_am(\"index.qmd\")\n\nhere() starts at /Users/txomin/Desktop/My_Blog\n\nload(here(\"Data\", \"Data_Frames\", \"data.Rda\"))\n\nBefore we start, some cleaning: We are only interested in houses which are located in Bizkaia. Also, we want to restrict the data to houses which are for sale but not for rent.\n\ndim(data %>% filter(is.na(ad_description))) [1] / dim(data) [1]  \n\n[1] 0.03276286\n\ndata = data %>% \n  drop_na(ad_description) %>% \n  filter(loc_zone != \"Álava\") %>%\n  filter(loc_city != \"Vitoria-Gasteiz\") %>%\n  filter(!grepl(\"Alquiler\", house_type)) %>% # Zur Miete\n  filter(room_num != \"sin habitación\") %>%\n  mutate(room_num = as.numeric(room_num))\n\nThe text data can be found under the variable ad_description. Using it we can build our corpus for analysis. To analyse the occurence frequence of word, each word needs to be assigned a row. This can be done using the function unnest_tokens().\n\ncorpus = tibble(line = 1:dim(data) [1], text = data$ad_description)  %>%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% na.omit()\n\nNaturally, The corpus contains alot of stop words. Stop words like “and”, “it”, or “this” are are essential, they however do not contain context specific information. Because our corpus is in Spanish, we use the dictionary tm::stopwords(\"spanish\") from the tm text mining package to load in the beeded stop words. We use anti_join() to then delete them from the data.\n\nspanish_stop_words <- bind_rows(stop_words,\n                               tibble(word = tm::stopwords(\"spanish\"),\n                                          lexicon = \"custom\")) %>% filter(lexicon == \"custom\")\n\ncorpus = corpus %>% anti_join(spanish_stop_words)\n\nJoining, by = \"word\"\n\n\nLets have a look at the results: Because there are alot of word frequencies alanysed, we will only plot words which are occuring more than 5000 times.\n\ncorpus_freq = corpus %>%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nglimpse(corpus_freq)\n\nRows: 20,789\nColumns: 2\n$ word <chr> \"cocina\", \"baño\", \"salón\", \"piso\", \"vivienda\", \"habitaciones\", \"z…\n$ n    <int> 19732, 18120, 15118, 14923, 14175, 14076, 12512, 11975, 10843, 10…\n\n\n\ncorpus_freq %>%\n  filter(n > 5000) %>%\n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(n, word)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(y = NULL)"
